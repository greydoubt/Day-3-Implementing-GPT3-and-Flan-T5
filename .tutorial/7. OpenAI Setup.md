# OpenAI and Libraries
In order to access GPT3, we are going to use [OpenAI's API](https://openai.com/api/).

##  Creating an OpenAI Account and Retrieving Your API Key
1. Create an account
2. After you have created an account, navigate to your profile icon in the top right of the screen and click "View API Keys"
3. Create a new secret key. 
4. Save your API key using [Replit secrets](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/workspace-features/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables) to the env variable "OPENAI_API_KEY"


Once you have an API key, we can check in the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) how we need to use it.

```python
import os

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

**__Note, this is a PAID API__**, as a new user you will receive some credits but it is very important to be careful of where you share your key and how often you make requests. [More info on their pricing here.](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) 

## Implementing GPT3 Davinci-003
OpenAI has [many different models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) for different use cases.
All of them require that we import the OpenAI library in addition to defining our API key as we did above:

```python
import openai
```
It is easier to get a sense of what these models and their parameters can do using [the Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground). 

Try swapping out our responses from Flan-T5 with GPT-3's Davinci-003 model in our interface on your own using the ['completions' endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create?lang=python).
