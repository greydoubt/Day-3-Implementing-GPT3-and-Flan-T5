# Implementing Flan-T5 and GPT3 

## Course Introduction
  Now that we have an interface working, it is time to turn it up a notch. In this course, we will build on the example we made in Day 2 and **learn how to use two of the most popular language models today: OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's Flan-T5.**

GPT-3 and Flan-T5 are two of the most advanced language models available and they offer some of the most exciting potential for natural language processing. **They can generate text, answer questions, and even create code!**

**We will face two new ways of loading these models.**

First, using the Huggingface Transformers library, we will **run inference right here in Replit like you would if you were running models on your own server.**

Second, we will use the OpenAI API to access one of, if not the **most powerful LLM released to date.**
We will also discuss a bit further the ethics of using such a model.

Tomorrow we will **finish up this course by creating a GPT3 powered auto-summarizer for any size text!!**
